# Schmidrules Application Architecture

Easy application architecture documentation and assertion.
Supported languages:
* Java
* C/C++


### The Maven Plugin ###
In order to include the architecture assertion in your CI Build Pipeline (Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity etc.) 
use the maven plugin of SchmidRules. The plugin will give you meaningful messages, when your architecture 
description is not inline with the real architecture and will produce a build failure in such a case.
